# GoGoAnime APP
**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app. I am still learning this new skill and personally, I like the way it deals with UI and data presentation.

## What could it do
* Getting recent release, movie, new season, popular and genre anime
* Displaying anime information and listing its episodes
* Choosing a server and play anime inside your broswer (Only video)
* Downloading anime (maybe)

There might be ads popping up when you play videos but it is from the website itself. There is nothing you could do about it.

This is still under development. As for now, it could only get recent release, movie, new season and genre and you will be redirected to your web broswer.

## How to run this project
~~~~
npm install
react-native run-ios
~~~~
For Android, there will be apk file under release tab.

For IOS, you need to download xcode and run this project. Please note this app will only work for 7 days if you do not have a developer account. You have to run it again after 7 days. I dont think this app will be on AppStore
