**This is not the official app**

It has been rewritten with `Flutter` to have bettter iOS and tablets support

</div>

# Features
- Latest anime
- Seaonal anime
- Movie & Popular anime
- Genre list
- Search anime
- Side drawer design
- Watch history
- Favourite anime list
- Auto update
- No popups while watching anime (IOS and Android only)

I have abondoned this project for about 2 years but it is finally back. A complete rework is undergoing because `AnimeOne` doesn't have some old animes. Flutter is now used instead of React Native. Some features are still under development but it is now stable enough to use. So far, it has been great. 

# Downloads
Only android build is available and you can download the apk from [release](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/releases/latest). However, IOS version is also being tested and it works fine like Android. You could [compile](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/tree/master/AnimeGo/README.md) it yourself or maybe I will provide the IPA file.
