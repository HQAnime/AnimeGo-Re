**This is not the official app**

It has been rewritten with `Flutter` to support IOS, tablets and web.

如果你喜歡中文字幕的話，可以嘗試[AnimeOne](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeOne)。

# Features
- Latest anime
- Seaonal anime
- Movie & Popular anime
- Genre list
- Search anime
- Side drawer design
- Watch history (wip)
- Favourite anime list (wip)
- Auto update (wip)
- No popups while watching anime (IOS and Android only)

I have abondoned this project for about 2 years but it is finally back. A complete rework is undergoing because `AnimeOne` doesn't have some old animes. Flutter is now used instead of React Native. Some features are still under development but it is now stable enough to use. You could try [the web version](https://henryquan.github.io/AnimeGo-Re) now.

# Downloads
Only android build is available and you can download the apk from [release](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/releases/tag/1.2.0) (currently still in preview). However, IOS version is being tested and it works fine. You could [compile](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/tree/master/AnimeGo/README.md) it yourself.
