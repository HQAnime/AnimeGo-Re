# GoGoAnime APP
**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app. I am still learning this new skill and personally, I like the way it deals with UI and data presentation.

## What could it do
* [x] Getting recent release, movie, new season, popular and genre anime
* [x] Displaying anime information and listing its episodes
* [x] Choosing a server and play anime inside this app (uwp only)
* [x] Latest -> WatchAnime -> AnimeDetail
* [x] Adding sub category list
* [x] Adding about inside this app

There might be ads popping up when you play videos but it is from the website itself. There is nothing you could do about it.

## How to run this project
~~~~

## How to install it on you device
### Android

## Known issues
~~* Three finger gesture will crash this app on OnePlus devices (debug)~~
* May crush randomly
* Slow and buggy 


(Try searching conan or one piece..., it is fine for short anime)
* Episode may not be in order
* May have weird issues if you scroll SUPER fast

Hopefully, they could be fixed in the future

## What's next?
I will rewrite [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift) using react native and it will be open sourced as well (why not >_<). It is going to be published on Google Play. 

For IOS, it might be a bit troublesome but it should be fine I hope. I need to draw my diagrams >_<.
