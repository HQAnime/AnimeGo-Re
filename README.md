# GoGoAnime APP
**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app.

**Please note that currently only Android version is working properly. IOS and UWP will be updated soon**

## What could it do
* [x] Getting recent release, movie, new season, popular and genre anime from [gogoanime.io](www.gogoanime.io)
* [x] Search Anime
* [x] Displaying anime information and listing its episodes
* [x] Choosing a server and play anime inside your broswer
* [x] Drawer for Android and Tab for IOS

There might be ads popping up when you play videos but it is from the website itself.
