# GoGoAnime APP
**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app. I am still learning this new skill and personally, I like the way it deals with UI and data presentation.

## What could it do
* Getting recent release, movie, new season, popular and genre anime
* Displaying anime information and listing its episodes
* Choosing a server and play anime inside your broswer (Only video)
* Downloading anime ~~(maybe)~~

There might be ads popping up when you play videos but it is from the website itself. There is nothing you could do about it.

## How to run this project
~~~~
npm install
react-native run-ios
~~~~
For Android, you could download [here](https://github.com/HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime/releases)

For IOS, you need to download xcode and run this project. Please note this app will only work for 7 days if you do not have a developer account. You have to run it again after 7 days. ~~I dont think this app will be on AppStore~~

(try search conan or one piece..., it is fine for short anime)
