# GoGoAnime APP
**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app.
This app works for **UWP** and **Android**. However, IOS might not be support by me but it will not take much time to port to IOS.

## What could it do
- New release
- New season
- Movie & Popular anime
- Schedule list
- ToWatch list
- Genre list
- Search anime

There might be ads popping up when you play videos but please note that it is from the website itself. This app does not contain any ads. ~~Therefore, I earn nothing and will become poorer the more app I make.~~

## How to run this project
~~~~
npm install
react-native link
react-native run-android
~~~~
Please note for UWP, all vector icons need to be linked manully. Follow the description [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).

## How to install it on your device
### **Android**
Download from [release](https://github.com/HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime/releases)

This app could be updated easily inside settings

~~Also, you could get it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yihengquan.gogoanime)
no longer available on Google Play because it is removed by Google~~
### **IOS**
Please link all libraries and change all stylings so that it fits IOS. It could run on your device for **7 days** without developer account or forever with one.
### **Windows 10**
Download from [microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-AU/store/p/anime-go/9mx3qr26zfdj?rtc=1)

*UWP version is not frequently maintained, I will only update it when I feel like doing so.*
